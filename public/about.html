  <p>My name is Goodnews Anjolaoluwa Babade. I'm 14 years old. 
    I am a student at Wheeler High School. I'm a Virgo‚ôç. My birthday is August 28, 2009. 
    I love music, skateboarding, art, reading and learning. 
    I'm in the orchestra program, and I'm involved in Science Olympiad and CircuitRunners. 
    I am the co-director of marketing for the USA Bio-Olympiad team at the school.
  My favorite animals are Pandas.
    I love Panadas because they are adorable and nonchalant. 
    The Panda also generally symbolizes luck and peace. My #1 vacation spot would be Greece.</p>
